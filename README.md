HackerMan is a concept for a hacking minigame. Navigate your little square around a randomly generated maze to get to the blue terminals. At the terminals, solve the puzzle by swapping the pieces. Once you complete all of the terminals, you will get pulled out Mission Impossible style!

Press Enter to Start. Press Space to navigate the menus and complete the puzzles. Use Arrow Keys to move.
